## Learning JavaScript Syntax with Blackjack

A simplified version of Blackjack to teach myself a bit of JavaScript syntax. No betting or splitting, only hitting or standing, 1v1 against the dealer. 

To try the game, `cd` to this directory and run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then go navigate with your browser to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to play! Hit `ctrl-c` to kill the server when you're done.

The `python` directory contains a python module providing the same gameplay as a cli. I did this quickly for my own reference, so that the logic would be mapped out and I could focus on thinking about new syntax. You can try it with

```bash
cd python
python -m blackjack
```

Have fun!
